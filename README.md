# probable_dementia_SHARE
This is the data documentation for preprocessing and analysis yielding figures and tables included in the paper Performance of probable dementia classification in a European multi-country survey, published in Scientific Reports.

To setup, fetch data from SHARE and store in a folder named data.
Then, create another folder with a R poject and store the RMD file here. Create subfolders 'data', and 'scripts' and store the R files in scripts.

Now you can open the RMD file and run chunk by chunk. The initial chunks will take care of loading and installing packages required for the analyses. 
Further, chunks will run scripts to merge and preprocess the data.

If you run into issues, please reach out to the first author of the paper, Matthias Klee (currently matthias.klee@uni.lu).
